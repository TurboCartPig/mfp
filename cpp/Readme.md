Her er en hel haug d√•rlig kode laga i sammenheng med faget mattematikk for programmering.

## Build

This is a standard cmake project, but in short, to build the project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make a build directory
3. Run cmake inside the build directory
4. Run whatever generator you ended up with
5. Google what all of this means

#### Note

All the applications depend on SFML. So cmake needs to be able to find it.

On linux I recommend using your distribution's package manager, and on windows, [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is a good option.
